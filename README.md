# Netflix-Recommendation-System
Project Overview:
This project involved building a sophisticated content recommendation system for Netflix using only Microsoft Excel. By leveraging advanced Excel features—such as complex formulas, pivot tables, and data visualization tools—the model aimed to deliver personalized content suggestions based on user viewing behavior, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.

Objectives:

* Develop an Excel-based model to analyze user viewing data and generate personalized content recommendations.

* Drive viewer engagement and increase content consumption through tailored suggestions.

* Demonstrate Excel’s ability to handle large datasets for statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Compiled user profiles, watch history, ratings, and preferences within Excel.

Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed data using Excel functions—removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Applied Excel’s statistical tools, including correlation analysis, to identify trends and patterns in user behavior.

Pivot Tables: Used pivot tables to segment data and gain insights into viewer preferences.

Predictive Modeling: Built formulas to predict user preferences, implementing linear regression via Excel’s Data Analysis Toolpak.

Dashboard Design: Created interactive dashboards to visualize insights and simulate real-time content recommendations based on user input.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel: Utilized end-to-end for data analysis, modeling, visualization, and interactive simulations.

Results:
The model successfully identified user preferences and generated relevant content recommendations, resulting in increased average watch time and session frequency. Pilot feedback indicated improved user satisfaction due to more accurate suggestions.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated that Microsoft Excel can serve as a powerful platform for building data-driven recommendation systems. It offered a cost-effective and accessible solution for enhancing user experience. Future enhancements may include the use of advanced Excel functions or integration with other tools for real-time analytics and scalability.
